Playing with TypeScript again.

Idea is to convert comma separated string (or a string with a few lines) 
into nice, formatted list of separate items.

I actully wrote this progam under Windows long time ago and use it for coding purpuses. 
I'm planning to rewrite it with WPF.

But this is not an Angular example. Pure HTML + TypeScript. 

thank you,
Sam Klok
