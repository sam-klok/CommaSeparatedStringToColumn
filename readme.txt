Playing with TypeScript again.

Idea is to convert comma separated string (or a string with a few lines) 
into nice, formatted list of separate items.

I actully wrote this progam under Windows long time ago and use it for coding purpuses. 
I'm planning to rewrite it with WPF. 
But for now, let's try TypeScript, should work everywhere - just download locally on your PC.

Funny that many TypeScript errors, explained on Stack Overflow as "Angular" errors.. :)
But this is not an Angular example. Pure HTML + TypeScript. 

thank you,
Sam Klok
